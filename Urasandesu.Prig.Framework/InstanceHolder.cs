        //       * Instantiate a closure in any members of a generic type. It will be generated as a nested generic type automatically, 
        //         so the member will be not JIT till running at each AppDomain.
        //       * Define any generic methods. Generic methods are JITed against each generic method instance by CLR's design, 
        //         so the results will be mixed with the result of another AppDomain.
        //       * Cast a type to another type. Because CLR validates whether the AppDomain that the type belongs is correct in this timing. 
        //         Note that some standard APIs will perform it internally. For example, don't use the type of not domain-neutral assembly as the key of `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`.
        //         It finds the concrete type implementing the interface `System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T>` that depends on the key 
        //         to calculate the container that houses the value. Of course the result has to cast to the interface.
